 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jvmti, noras, feature_282, vm6, jdk, nonconcurrent]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * Description :
 *     Test tries to load jvmti agent to the VM after the VM has started using
 *     Attach API (com.sun.tools.attach).
 *     Test is based on the nsk.share.aod framework. In the terms of this framework
 *     java application running in the VM where agent is loaded to is called 'target application'.
 *     Test scenario:
 *         - during initialization agent gets capabilities 'can_tag_objects', 'can_generate_object_free_events'
 *         enables ObjectFree events and registers native methods used by target application
 *         - target application creates object, tags it (using jvmti environment obtained by loaded agent) and
 *         provokes collection of this object. Agent should receive ObjectFree event for the tagged object.
